# Macahine Learning using Iris Data and Python

So here you can find a VERY simple machine learning script which uses the well-known Iris data and a user based input 
that asks the user to type-in the best model for the provided data.

## Getting Started

Now for this script to work you will need to download Python 3 as well as Matplotlib, Sklearn and Pandas modules.
Alternatively just download Anaconda or Spyder for python 3, which they contain the mentioned python modules.

### Prerequisites

If you downloaded Anaconda or Spyder you are set to go

If you installed python 3 then you should click [HERE](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#basic-usage)

### Why this script?

I you understand what the practical side of Machine Learning and you are new to Python then this script is for you. In case that
you are new to Machine Learning and new to Python this script is for you too, but WILL have to scratch a bit deeper to understand
the meaning of the steps that script takes.
